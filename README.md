Clean, professional, and built for scale. **Logis** is a customer-facing interface designed specifically for global logistics and utility management. It provides industrial clients with a calm, clear way to monitor their consumption, manage active service contracts, and handle team-wide security permissions.

> **Note**: This is a frontend-focused concept project created for my portfolio. It's built to demonstrate high-end UI/UX, complex state management, and modern React 19 implementation. All data is currently mocked, and forms serve as UI demonstrations.
